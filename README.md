# The-Power-Of-Words
## [I Want to Play](https://preview.p5js.org/DavidZ088/present/KDnxHIxyS)
A simple game developed using P5.js to show the effect our our lanaguge used.
In development, the project uses lists and classes to create different objects and define the behaviors of the obejcts upon user keyboard inputs.
The game utilizes abstract art and interactive art to create environments that supports the tone and mood of image shown. It consists with lists of postive and negative words. Upon User entries, the resulting images change based on the ratio of the amount of positove and negtaive words. For furture imporvments, I want to add weight to each of the vocalbularies. \
